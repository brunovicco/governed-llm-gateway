# Gateway Operational Readiness

This track is independent from Phase 14 consumer integrations. It turns the existing governed execution
core into a locally demonstrable operational platform without changing the permanent authorization
sequence or pulling forward OpsLens, RAGForge, or Verifiable AI Governance work.

## Authority boundary

The permanent invariant remains:

```text
Gateway allowed set ⊆ Policy Router authorized set
```

Operational readiness may add read models, telemetry export, dashboards, local infrastructure and a
read-only console. None of those surfaces may authorize a deployment, widen policy, resurrect a
rejected candidate, execute business tools, or mutate runtime policy.

Evidence is not authority. Telemetry is not authority. Health is not authority.

## OR-0 foundation audit

The September 2026 audit established the following baseline before product-readiness changes:

- Phase 9 OpenTelemetry instrumentation already exists on top of `a2a-otel-kit`;
- `gateway-core` pins `a2a-otel-kit==0.6.0`;
- gateway attributes pass through the kit sanitizer plus a gateway-specific allowlist;
- default telemetry is metadata-only;
- W3C trace propagation is covered across gateway/provider HTTP and SSE boundaries;
- provider-attempt retry/fallback events and streaming lifecycle telemetry already exist;
- Phase 10/11 benchmark evidence and later operational evidence are already separate from
  authorization;
- process-local health, process-local attempt recording, content-addressed sample batches and reviewed
  operational snapshots are intentionally distinct abstractions;
- the gateway repository did not yet contain a local Collector + Tempo + Grafana stack;
- the gateway repository did not yet contain a dedicated operations read model/API or React Gateway
  Console;
- Collector receipt verification existed as a reusable pattern in `a2a-otel-kit` but not yet as a
  gateway integration/e2e proof.

PC-15 subsequently added the pinned local Collector + Tempo + Grafana foundation. PC-16 added the
credential-free positive Collector receipt proof. PC-17 added optional executable-process ownership of
`Observability.configure()` / injection / shutdown while preserving the original metadata-only and
non-authoritative boundaries. PC-18 begins OR-3 with a typed application-layer operations projection
that has no HTTP or control-plane authority.

The audit also found documentation drift: the previous observability document still described Phase 9
runtime tracing as future work even though Phase 9 is already complete.

## Reuse boundary with a2a-otel-kit

`a2a-otel-kit` is the observability foundation, not the home for gateway domain concepts.

Reuse from the kit:

- `Observability` lifecycle;
- OTLP/HTTP export;
- W3C Trace Context propagation;
- deny-by-default attribute sanitization;
- metadata-safe structured events;
- flush/shutdown semantics;
- Collector configuration patterns;
- Tempo and Grafana local-demo patterns;
- positive Collector receipt verification;
- optional A2A/MCP trace continuity.

Keep in the gateway:

- model registry and registry provenance;
- policy authorization/enforcement;
- candidate eligibility/ranking and route explain;
- runtime health/circuit state;
- retry/fallback semantics;
- benchmark evidence;
- operational evidence/completeness;
- process composition and the decision to enable/inject the observability facade;
- operations read models/APIs;
- Gateway Console.

The dependency direction remains:

```text
Gateway -> a2a-otel-kit -> OpenTelemetry/OTLP -> Collector -> backends
```

Do not add a Langfuse SDK to the gateway or to `a2a-otel-kit` for this track.

## Delivery sequence

The sequence is intentionally incremental; later items may be reordered when a concrete dependency
requires it, but authority/security boundaries take precedence over visual/demo convenience.

| Track | Scope | Current state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OR-0 | current observability/product-readiness audit | baseline recorded |
| OR-1 | telemetry vocabulary hardening | active |
| OR-2 | local OTel Collector + Tempo + Grafana foundation | foundation + positive receipt complete |
| process activation | optional process-owned OTel lifecycle | complete in PC-17 |
| OR-3 | typed read-only operations read model | typed foundation in PC-18; process/API wiring deferred |
| OR-4 | read-only Operations API | not started |
| OR-5 | React/TypeScript/Vite Gateway Console | not started |
| OR-6 | Grafana dashboards + trace correlation/deep links | not started |
| OR-7 | optional Langfuse OTLP fan-out | optional / not started |
| OR-8 | one-command deterministic local demo | not started |
| OR-9 | authentication/security hardening for operational surfaces | not started |
| OR-10 | final docs, screenshots, demo and product-readiness validation | not started |

OR-1 is split into small increments. Issue #83 declares the compatibility vocabulary and updates the
Phase 9 documentation before any external observability stack is added.

PC-15 and PC-16 are bounded OR-2 increments. PC-17 closes the separate process-owned observability
lifecycle prerequisite. PC-18 is the first bounded OR-3 increment. None of these increments implicitly
completes an Operations API, Tempo query verification, Grafana visualization, dashboards or any later
operations surface.

## Read-only operations boundary

The first operations surface must be read-only and explicitly composed from typed gateway-owned data.
A UI must not inspect arbitrary internal objects or provider SDK state.

PC-18 introduces `OperationsReadModelService` and an immutable `OperationsSnapshot` in
`gateway-core/application`. The projection is built only from the validated `ModelRegistry`, effective
`RankingPolicy`, an explicit read-only health inspection port and an optional already-verified
`OperationalEvidenceSnapshot`.

The health view is explicitly `process_local`. `InMemoryHealthInspectionAdapter` evaluates health on an
isolated replica of the in-memory tracker so dashboard-style reads cannot materialize live state or
advance the live circuit breaker. Operational-evidence absence is represented as `not_supplied`; it is
never converted to zero requests, zero errors or a healthy-fleet claim.

See `docs/project/OPERATIONS_READ_MODEL.md` for the typed projection and non-claims.

Candidate future endpoints include:

```text
GET /v1/ops/overview
GET /v1/ops/deployments
GET /v1/ops/deployments/{deployment_id}
GET /v1/ops/evidence
GET /v1/ops/evidence/operational
GET /v1/ops/evidence/benchmarks
GET /v1/ops/routing/recent
GET /v1/ops/system
```

This list is a product-readiness target, not an implemented API contract yet.

No direct mutation endpoint belongs in the first version. In particular, do not add unaudited buttons
or APIs for deployment disablement, circuit reset, registry/policy changes, or evidence promotion.

## Local observability target

The local infrastructure foundation is now:

```text
gateway-api
    │
    └── a2a-otel-kit -> OTLP/HTTP -> otel-collector -> tempo -> grafana
```

PC-15 provides the checked-in Collector, Tempo and Grafana Compose topology. PC-16 separately proves
that a known metadata-only Gateway span can reach an isolated Collector receipt surface. PC-17 owns
optional observability configuration at the executable process boundary and injects the configured
facade through the existing deployment/service composition path.

Observability is disabled by default. Explicit endpoint/environment process arguments enable it. A
runtime configuration failure degrades to null telemetry; a configured facade is shut down best-effort
when the runner returns or activation/runner fails. No telemetry backend is probed for startup or
readiness.

Langfuse may be added later as an optional downstream Collector/OTLP destination when its current
integration contract is reviewed. Its availability must never affect gateway inference.

The local stack uses pinned image versions, loopback host bindings, `no-new-privileges`, dropped Linux
capabilities where compatible, read-only configuration mounts and no hardcoded secrets. Demo-only
Grafana authentication relaxations are documented as local only and must not be presented as a
production configuration.

## Evidence presentation rules

The future console/dashboard must not fabricate metrics or reason codes.

When data is absent, the backend read model must represent absence explicitly. Process-local samples
must not be labeled fleet-complete. Cost is shown only when the gateway has real cost evidence. Routing
visualization must display gateway-produced reason codes rather than deriving authorization or health
reasons in the frontend.

Trace views in the Gateway Console remain a correlation surface, not a replacement for Tempo/Grafana
or another trace explorer.

## CI boundary

Default CI remains deterministic and credential-free:

- no real provider API required;
- no SaaS observability backend required;
- no secret required;
- no Langfuse Cloud dependency;
- live-provider tests remain opt-in.

PC-16 adds an explicit Docker-based `collector-receipt` integration workflow. It starts only a local
receipt Collector, performs a bounded startup probe, emits one metadata-only span through
`a2a-otel-kit`, requires positive appended receipt evidence and always tears the Collector down.
Exporter `flush()` success alone is not sufficient proof of Collector receipt.

PC-17 lifecycle contracts do not open a socket or require a Collector. They inject deterministic test
doubles at the process boundary to prove default-disabled behavior, explicit settings, degradation,
injection and shutdown semantics.

PC-18 read-model contracts are also credential-free and network-free. They prove deterministic
projection, explicit evidence absence, exact ranking/registry provenance and non-mutating inspection of
process-local health.

Changes to the shared observability/readiness documentation trigger both the positive-receipt and local
Compose validation workflows so the documented contract and the executable infrastructure are
validated on the same candidate SHA.

## Next slice

Before OR-4 exposes an HTTP surface, the next OR-3 dependency audit must decide how the typed read model
is composed with the already-materialized application/process state without giving the API a new path
to secrets, provider SDK internals, Policy Router calls or mutable resilience controls. Recent routing
history remains a separate persistence/read-model concern and must not be fabricated from current
health or ranking configuration.

## Completion rule

No OR increment is considered complete until its pull request is merged and the corresponding
post-merge `main` CI is green. Product-ready demo status requires the full operational stack, read-only
operations surfaces, console, trace correlation, reproducible local demo, security review,
documentation and final post-merge validation.
